                                       Odin's Recipes                                                       

I started The Odin Project less then a week ago and have learned a lot already. To be completely honest I'm kinda proud to be building my first website. Was going to get creative with the last lesson but was hoping the project was something like this. Learnt to trust in Odin. 

If anyone reads me. I am very gratful for this program and it is very educational for me. very grateful for music also for the long nights.....very grateful.

My First Website 
     ^ ^
    '...'
I'll be building a website with 3 different links to webpages with recipes from an old cook book. The pictures wont be real, would be nice, hungry thinking about it. When finished with this project I hope to show the ability to build a wedsite with the skills bestowed upon me. Hope none read me. Figured everything out to build my code, website looks good with it's 3 pages. Really needs some color. Actually used ai to copy the text from an image then move to the code line. Kinda cool
