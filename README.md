                                       Odins Recipes                                                       

I started The Odin Project less then a week ago and have learned a lot already. Bought a computer for $250 a few weeks ago for the hopes of returning to college at the age of 38......Got into a General Arts and Science course.Plan on starting in May, didn't want to wait and found out that there are a ton of free program/courses online. Been slowly buying "supplies" for my little setup/startup. To be completely honest I'm kinda proud to be building my first website. Was going to get creative with the last lesson but was hoping the project was something like this. Learnt to trust in Odin. 

If anyone reads me. I am very gratful for this program and it is very educational for me. Music also for the long nights.....very grateful.

My First Website 
     ^ ^
    '...'

    I'll be building a website with 3 different links to webpages with recipes from my moms cook book. The pictures wont be real, would be nice, hungry thinking about it. When finished with this project I hope to show the ability to build a wedsite with the skills bestowed upon me. Hope none read me.
